    <h1>Exploring Diani</h1>
    <p>
      Daini Beach Kenya is often referred to as a collective term for a group of
      interconnected beaches located south of Mombasa that make up Diani Beach.

      which each stretch for 15 kilometers over powdery white sand.
      Additionally, there are beaches such as Tiwi, Diani, Galu, Kikondo, and
      Chale that are also worth visiting on a Kenya Safari Tour to Diani Beach.
