      <h1>What is music</h1>
      <p>
        Music is the art of organizing sound in time, typically involving
        elements such as melody, harmony, rhythm, timbre, texture, and dynamics.
        It is generally defined as humanly-organized sound, usually created for
        the purpose of emotional expression or achieving beauty. This
        organization can include both sounds and deliberate silences, which
        together shape the music's form and tension. At its core, music is a
        cultural universal present in all human societies, serving as a means of
        personal expression, cultural preservation, and communication.
