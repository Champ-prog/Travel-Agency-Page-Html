      <h1>Types of Music</h1>
      <p>
        Music encompasses a vast array of genres and styles, often categorized
        by their historical origin, geographical roots, instrumentation, rhythm,
        and cultural context. Classifications can be broad or highly specific,
        with many genres having sub-genres and overlapping characteristics.
        Major categories include classical, pop, rock, hip-hop, electronic,
        jazz, metal, punk, folk, country, and many others, each with its own
        distinct features and evolution over time.
